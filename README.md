## Model Overview
The project encompasses several key stages, including data acquisition and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model development and evaluation. Two main types of models are employed:

- **Traditional Machine Learning Methods**: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Elastic Net.
- **Neural Network Model**: A TensorFlow-based model with multiple layers, optimized for capturing complex patterns in housing market data.

## Evaluation and Insights
Models are rigorously evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Insights drawn from these analyses provide valuable predictions and trends in the real estate market, aiding buyers, sellers, and investors in making informed decisions.
